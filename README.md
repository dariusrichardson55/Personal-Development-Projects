# Personal-Development-Projects


<h1>Description</h1>
As a cybersecurity analyst, it is critical to always familiarise with software and tools that are currently used in businesses to be able to analyse data and identify
peculiar patterns that could be an indication of potential cyberattacks which is why I took it upon myself to provide personal development projects as a way to self-learn
as well as to demonstrate my understanding of using software and tools that can be applied in a working environment.



These projects provide demonstrations of how to use software and tools within cybersecurity.
